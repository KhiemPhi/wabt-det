From AP:

The $85 billion figure resembles a number from a July 30 quarterly report from SIGAR, which outlined that the U.S. has invested about $83 billion to build, train and equip Afghan security forces since 2001….

…funding included troop pay, training, operations and infrastructure along with equipment and transportation over two decades. only about $18 billion of that sum went toward equipping Afghan forces between 2002 and 2018, a June 2019 SIGAR report showed.

If you take into account obsolescence (look that one up Madge) and the cost of transportation back to the US of out of date hardware your statement as one has come to expect is a joke.

You really are the poster girl for stupid bring the new smart in the Republican Party.

Just to close, it was Trump and Pompeo who surrendered Afghanistan back to the Taliban and released 5000 Taliban as a going away present. Throwing afghan women under the bus and slow walking SIVs for Afghan interpreters and those that helped Americans at the risk of retribution.
