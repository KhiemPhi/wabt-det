"I guess that US regime change of Ukraine turning it into a big extremely hostile, anti-Russian NATO base is perfectly legitimate too? Oh right‚Ä¶. that part doesn‚Äôt fit into the Western narrative",0
What about those Iranian/Russian drones? Unmanned and killing civilians. What do you call that?,0
"It's not just that this is during war, but some of those ships are literally firing off the missiles hitting the cities, daily. There could not be a fairer target.",0
"Right, those same warships are routinely launching cruise missiles to strike *civilian* targets in Odesa, Mykolaiv etc.

Pretty galling to engage in state terrorism and then try to label attempts to destroy the threat ""terrorism"".",0
It‚Äôs funny isn‚Äôt it - how awful of them to fight back   üò¢,0
"Minor damage to two ships, in return for a cancelled grain deal, which was Ukraine's economic lifeline.

Yet another Ukrainian own-goal.

üòÇüòÇüòÇ",0
"After so MANY years of F-ing around, Russia is FINALLY finding out. In the most painful and humiliating way possible.",0
"I agree 100%. We all know that Russia has been using such devices. So, there is nothing wrong with doing the same. In fact, I would encourage Ukraine to use more drones, etc to send the Russians back to Russia.",1
The second picture clearly shows a powerful blast hitting a long-hulled vessel amidships. That's unlikely to be survivable. My guess it was a Grigorovich-class frigate loaded with cruise missiles on its way to commit more war crimes being de-nazified permanently.,0
"At first, Ukrainians didn't want to take part of the deal bc they feared being vulnerable to attacks. Why would Russia tolerate it? Isn't it like bombing humanitarian corridors?",0
"Specially because these military targets were used to atack non-military targets, like energy, nurseries, schools, hospitals and children..",0
??? That is a military target not some school or hospital.,0
"Yes, absolutely. But it does not make it easier for those countries who are now left without grain from Odessa. This not about how to conduct a war, this is about how to manage a humanitarian corridor.",0
If Ukraine sinks the entire Black Sea fleet guess what grains exports start again. Anyone worried about starvation needs to send Ukraine some more anti ship missiles,0
The ships protected the food corridor.,0
"Legally, ruZZia is not at war with Ukraine.
It is ""Special Military Operation"".
Meaning of that term is that ruZZians can do anything to Ukraine but Ukraine has no right to fight back, because they are not at war.

Welcome to rashist newspeak ü§™
RuZZians are exceptional.",0
"its not legitimate when you agreed an agricultural deal based on having a peaceful black sea..

Not that more than 4% of the grain was going to  real starving countries anyway...

But lets not the facts get in the way of reality..",0
"But sonce the UN deal Russian warships have been launching cruise missiles from these vessels located in Black Sea, hardly adhering to your ideals of a peaceful region. Or is it ok for Russian aggression as long as there is no retaliation?",0
Wait: so Ukraine armed forces strike an enemy warship on Ukraine territory; how is that terrorism ?,0
remarkable considering the bombardment of defenceless Ukraine civilians carried out by the Russians for most of this year,0
What about when Russia shell civilian targets in Ukraine?,1
"Yes. However, as they are British led and US satellites are used for navigation, both the US and UK are legitimate targets now?
Soon we will all live in the the global south once the north turns to glass.",0
"Given that the intent was clearly to abuse and sabotage the humanitarian line of grain export...

Let's see what tune you start singing when RU lights up UA ships and ports... üôÑ",0
"You did not get the memo; To not have been informed about or made aware of a situation, especially one that most or many other people know about already.

-War with Ukraine is Over.

""It's a war against NATO, a war for our country's survival,"" Solovyov said on Russian state tele",0
"Probably not sunk, but probably heavily damaged

Initial reports said something sank tho, & that 5 were damaged. But we just dont know yet, & Russia never admits anything

They still insist Moskva was a random small fire onboard coupled with a storm (that didnt actually exist) üôÑ",0
They struck ships that's were involved in the war too,0
"There is no war because it is a ""special military operation"" LOL",0
Navy is by definition a legitimate target!!!!,0
"Yes, but this is not the question. A humanitarian corridor is not a legitimate firing position. This attack ended grain export from Odessa.",0
Waters around Sevastopol are not humanitarian corridor. And in fact Russian Navy has used them to reach missile launch sites against civilian targets which Navy is obviously not. Russia has decided to use this as an excuse.,0
But  not England !,0
"Of course, but historically Russia has never admitted that others have the right to self-defense, because they are always right and have the ""moral authority"".",0
How are they different from cruise missiles?,0
Let me get this straight - Russia invaded Ukraine and now it's complaining that Ukraine is fighting back. Really?,0
Yeah...and cutting off Ukrainian wheat export by Russia during war times is also perfectly legitimate,0
Somehow different that using Iranian drones on civilian targets? MOD needs to get a grip that attacking military targets after you're the aggressor in a conflict doesn't equal terrorism.,0
"russia is erased from the worldmap. They are there, but we don't see them, we don't talk to them, we don't need them. And finally, we don't want them anymore. And maybe we never wanted them.",0
"Just remember the simple adage

Nothing Russia Says is ever true

That makes it easy",0
Military weapons targeting military ships. Pretty different from artillery and missiles used vs civilian neighborhoods and refugee convoys.,0
So that mean the port of Odessa being used to bring in weapons in returning grain ships is a legitimate military target.,0
"In this case, Russia has the right to strike at England, Germany and America, since Ukraine receives the supply of weapons and intelligence data from these countries.",0
"Not to mention Russia is illegally in Crimea, part of Ukraine.",0
"These guys ‚Ä¶Hypocrisy overload, like they haven‚Äôt been bombarding the country with artillery, cruise missiles, drones and whatever else for the past 10 months, Russian MOD dudes must have been on psycadelics the full time‚Ä¶ No words",0
"Besides, militaries have been using unmanned munitions and semi manned munitions since early 1900s. One man subs with a torpedo on them, gliders dropped from planes with bombs on them etc. it‚Äôs nothing new.",0
"Exactly. Now if they used the same drones to attack areas of high civilian concentration like Moscow's main commuter road in the morning then it could be. But who would go and do something like that, right Russia?",0
"Indeed, contrary to bombing civilian targets with unmanned drones. War crimes.",0
"I don't know why they are upset. It's war. They can drop whatever they like on Ukraine too, it's war.
Isn't that what war is? The idea is to win, at any cost.
I'd expect a serious response with no complaints from either side tbh.",0
"So, what does the Russian Ministry of Defense call the use of unmanned aerial drones and missiles to attack Ukranian civilians and infrastructure like schools?",1
What anti-surface warfare doing?,0
"If Russians aren't worried, they should be. Ukraine is coming. Winter is coming.",0
Nice.. Ukrainians winning by hitting legitimate military targets.,0
It is not just legitimate it is also very welcome,0
The Russians like to accuse others of what they themselves are guilty of already,0
"‚ÄúTerrorist attack‚Äù? Really?ü§î
No! It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúWAR‚Äù, which they started. 
-They were warned not to launch an unprovoked attack upon the ",0
It's where all of the Klibr cruise missiles are coming from right,0
"The land belongs to whomever can hold it and there are no rules as to how that might happen. 

For both sides.   We'll see who wants it more.",0
"How do we categorize Russian ""Special Operation""?",0
Also hitting Odessa port is legitimate,0
"""You sunk my battleship!""",0
MoD: Ministry of Defeat,0
Did Ukrain actually sink one?,0
Esp. since said Russian warships have been launching missiles toward Ukrainian cities from the Black Sea. Totally valid military target.,0
Ukraine barbad kab hoga... Russia jald hi khatam kar degi.... Ukraine aur Britten ko,0
It was a special military operation.,0
Well said,0
guess so but attacking the transport ships filled with grain against the grain agreement was over the line and a big mistake.,0
"You attacked their country and when they hit your ships you call them terrorist? Oh, the irony.",0
Has war been declared? Did I miss that?,0
"They also warned everyone not to post anything about it on social media.
Whinge whinge whinge...",0
Maybe it was Ukraine's special military operation üòâüòâ,0
"If #UkraineÔ∏è acted by the #Russian playbook there would be air raids from Sochi to Petersburg, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok.",0
Warships that are stationed inside Ukraine!,0
"Especially when those same warships are launching missiles on Ukrainian cities, targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.",0
"The Russian MoD is not only a paper tiger, it is a cry baby as well ü§£",0
Then why is west whining on the reinstallation of sea blocade?,1
I am surprised that someone is still listening to all these Russian statements.,0
and this is perfectly legitimate to cut grain transport accourding to breaking the rules .,0
"Yeah, and using kamikaze drons against civilians objects are perfectlly fine ü§£",1
While hitting civilian targets with iranian drones...,1
"Also, cutting a grain deal is a perfectly legitimate answer to that.",0
Especially if it also happens on the Ukrainian territory which is occupied by Russia.,0
Good point. Well within the rules of war especially when you consider Russia is launching attacks from well outside of Ukraine‚Äôs territory.,0
All should know that there are no winners in wars,0
And the Russians could just leave Ukraine - that would solve the entire situation,0
"I am old enough to remember that they shelled odesa port a day after signing this black sea agreement. Russian logic:
We shell odesa port. Legitimate target under the agreement 
Ukrainians attack sevastopol port. Terrorist act we withdraw from the agreement.",0
Well I suppose Russian strikes on military targets in Odessa port are fair game now. Or do you disagree with that? And if you do I‚Äôd love to hear your reasoning and logic,0
Was it legitimate for the British navy to involve in attacking Russian ships? Also was it legitimate for the royal navy to sabotage nordstream pipes?,0
So is Russia cutting out on allowing UKR grain ship thro Black sea. It's war. Stop begging for goodwill from enemy,0
‚Ä¶and those ships launched missiles targeting civilians populations in Ukraine,0
So stop crying when Russia strikes at Kiev,0
Then they must be appalled by the things they have done in Ukraine?,1
Don't cry when Russia retaliate....,0
"If that is so, then it must also be fair for Russia to stop the grain deal.
Rationally, you cannot have it both ways.",0
"So Britain is at war with Russia then? This wasn‚Äôt carried out by Ukraine - so, by your logic, Russia is entitled to bomb London? Gloves off fella, means gloves off - be careful what you seek to justify and the glee with how you say it publicly",0
They can reduce Kiev to rubbles in hours! Don't forget that! Expect another wave of missiles on Kiev,0
what about the iranian drones?,1
"So russians try to invade other country, failed to do so and wish not to loose any military equipment, the same used for launching rockets which fell on civilian buildings, killing innocent civilians. Well then. I don't know what to say. I hope you have good insurance company!",0
The police murder over 1000 people per year in the United States since at least 2015. So this number isn‚Äôt even that much further from the norm in America.,0
"It‚Äôs over 1000 deaths. Police don‚Äôt document these things. The databases are made up from obituaries, social media posts, police scanners, news reports etc. in 2019 they discovered over 1200 police deaths. Some sites say 1500. The 120 number does not seem unlikely",0
"In a population of 250 million adults, that's a good number. How much less of 1% is that? 0.00005%",0
Using the word murder is extreme hyperbole. There are around 1000 cop killings every year. Around 90% are armed and most and a large percentage are entirely justified. I say this as someone who believes we need widespread reforms to how we police.,1
"...out of 10000000 arrests in one of the most heavily armed countries in the world (which is 0.01% of arrests).
Black and Hispanic officers more likely to kill blacks than white officers. 

Of the 1000, 50% white, 25% black. 135 officers killed in 2019

Murder?",1
"It's not ""murder"" when police shoot an armed criminal, which is the majority of the cases.",0
"According to a LA times story, dying in the hands of the police is one of the leading cause for young black men. Around 1 in 1000 is expected to die from that.",0
"The true number is not know. We do not know how many cops there ae nor how many ppl they kill each year, it's all an estimate.",0
We shouldn‚Äôt have a norm,0
Source?,0
What? Yes!,0
"Only about 26 a year are in question for right / wrong. And of that the majority are justified. 

Bet you didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre 18x more likely to be killed as a cop then by one.",1
"This interchangeable use of ""killing"" and ""murder"" is reckless and wrong. Most police killings are justified, and therefore cannot be murder.

Too many police killings are murders, though. And many of the justified killings were avoidable, if cops were better at de-escalation.",0
Justified killings= murder?,0
Not murder when they shoot an armed criminal,0
Only if you knew the real stats and put out all of the stats not just look how many people where killed by cops. How about why were those people killed by cops and how about they stop committing crimes.,1
You aren‚Äôt factoring in the demographics of those killings and reasonings. Stats without details are pointless.,0
But you can't claim all of those are wrongful deaths by police. I'm sure many of them they were shot at so they had to shoot back.,1
"‚ÄúMurder.‚Äù So it‚Äôs a logical fallacy to believe a police shooting can be justified under the law?  Your statement; That‚Äôs an absolute, which is actually the logical fallacy here.",0
Back up your statement please,0
Lies,0
And how many were in self defense? Do not throw numbers out there without any evidence! We all know Floyd's long list of crimes.,1
2019 was a 30 year low in police caused deaths...facts matter.,0
How many were white and how many black cus apparently there is a difference I hear?,1
"Classifying all of these deaths as ""murders"" is incorrect. Most of these killings were justified. Please stop spreading misinformation.",0
"more than 15,500 people have died from gang violence across the United States in the last 3 years! Most of which or African Americans killing African Americans, but you ain‚Äôt ready for that conversation
",1
BS...there are criminals that violently fight them. You want a rapist hunting down your daughter?,0
"put the numbers killed by own own violent citizens over that time period and compare that to other western countries. 15,000 x 5 = 75000. in my country its less than 200 in 5 years. see how you're not after the real issue like so many in your country.",0
250k die at the hands of doctors each year from medical mistakes. What she would we do with the doctors?,1
Is there a source available?,0
happy to retweet this if it's ture but can you provide some sort of source?,0
"I wonder who has killed more Americans, police or Covid.",1
And how man black on black crimes involve shootings?? Trying to make police look bad is the stupidest angenda I‚Äôve ever seen.,1
What were the circumstances of the killings?,0
"How many Cops have been killed?, how many protesters have killed someone? Can we see figures?",1
"Since 2000, police have killed about 10 people in Finland. During the same period 2 police officers have died in duty. You can multiply these figures by 60 to compare to U.S., as we have 5.5M people in Finland.",0
Are you going to be that naive and think that all 120 lives are innocent?,1
Defund the police,0
Anyone trying to justify this: My country (Sweden) has had 38 ppl killed by police since 1990. And WE have issues!,0
SOMEBODY GO PROTEST WITH ME TONIGHT,0
More deaths than CORONOVIRUS,0
"I don't understand how opposition to this is controversial. No matter how people feel about capital punishment, can't we agree that the state should not murder people without a trial?",0
How is that even possible. Like. Genuinely asking. We don‚Äôt even get that many murders in my whole province in A YEAR.,0
You need TWO YEARS of training to be a cop in Germany.  Here it's 21 weeks.,0
"If this is ‚Äútrue‚Äù, then how about the number or black on black lives lost in cities such as Chicago, Atlanta, LA, etc. Do those black lives not matter because it doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative?",1
How many were Black?,0
"Damn, I didn‚Äôt know all of those people were 100% innocent and were killed for no reason",0
2020 is by far the worst year,0
Does this # include the 5 lynchings?,0
"Were these all unarmed? Need more info than just the number. There are reasons behind that number (right and wrong, I assume).",0
Well despite all the shit that's happened in the past 20 days. I'd say I'm impressed.,0
"Are you not gonna mention all of the innocent cops that have been killed by the people rioting? Mention the whole story, not just the part you want people to see. If you wanna be equal you have to show all sides.",0
Statement is upsetting. How many of these shootings were justifiable? You‚Äôre making it out to look that officers are going around killing people. This statement has omitted information to outrage the public. Your part of the problem not the solution.,1
This stat is skewed with all the unrest and anarchy going around.  Not saying we don‚Äôt need reform but let‚Äôs think about peoples anti police sentiment that causes the stat to be inflated,0
Most grateful for a link to the source of this horrendous number. Waititng patiently.,0
"In Ireland, from 2007 to 2016, police were involved in 129 fatalities.  TOTAL. In TEN YEARS.

And today the country is grieving because a policeman was killed. Because their police are respected.

Unlike in the US.",0
"Honestly, when I first read this, I read it backwards, 20 lives, 120 days.

Now I'm reading it again and like... WTF

Either way, its horrible.",0
24 young people were killed in Chicago alone over one weekend during the riots. 18 overnight. Not by police. The elephant in the room ... The US gun issue.,0
I don‚Äôt even call them cops. I call them murders with a privilege.,0
don‚Äôt forget the 5 that they lynched.,0
Yet another horrible milestone for America - Number 1 for the number of people killed by its own police force. Tragic.,0
"Over 1,000 in 2019.
  UK: 3
Denmark:  0",0
Lies rumor and PROPAGANDA. Here's the actual stats. However this list also doesn't state context. ,0
"How many of these people killed were a threat to the lively hood of the offices, and or others",1
Do you have a source?  I don‚Äôt doubt you but I would like to research myself.,0
does this include the guy they let drown saying he was faking pleading for help and repeatedly going under? ,0
"to put this in perspective:

1 officer has died as a result of the riots
9 officers have died in the line of duty since George Floyd's death

WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF?!",1
"By comparison, UK police have killed 28 people in the last 10 YEARS. All of who me were confirmed armed, and most of whole were committing terrorist acts.",0
120 out of 328.2million. While every loss of life is sad I‚Äôm sure they lose more to car crashes or cancer.,1
I‚Äôm sure 120 of those are Black people.,0
This is terrible!  USA needs to learn from Europe!,0
jeez. how are you tracking that? Feels like it should be a huge dashboard.,0
Let‚Äôs make a difference in this world!,0
"According to USA Today, 80000 Cops in the US have been charged with some criminal case over the last decade.
Don't think this should shock you much.",0
Source and how many of the 120 were armed,1
"That's about 6 murders each day, and 2190 per 365 days (a year)",0
And how many have been lynched with the government's support?,0
We dont even kill 120 people in 20 days who are on death row.,0
Don‚Äôt forget that baby that was a victim of miscarriage bcs a police officer kicked a pregnant woman‚Äôs stomach,0
To be fair there has to be a significant number of those that were justified killings. Not trying to excuse cops for killing ruthlessly and senselessly. But come on you can't just put the whole number out there as one big bad thing.,1
"Police brutality is a culture, not a matter of a few bad apples. ‚Äúbad apples come from rotten trees"" ",0
"Honestly i like this argument and i think its valid but if i tell my parents about it theyll just say ""OH WELL HOW MANY COPS D!ED?? HUH??? HOW MANY PPL DID THE RIOTERS K!LL"" and im sad that i cant argument back :(",0
This is crazy,0
Seems like they are getting more evil every day. Almost like they are thinking they are more above the law than usual,0
Defund the police department,0
Whaat? That's hardcore. Damn!!,0
Why would you think they would stop? Because people are running around in the streets?,0
"Correction: Police in the US have killed 120 people since George Floyd, *that have been reported and confirmed.*",0
"did the mental math, 6 a day",0
Can you please provide a source for this number? It'll be helpful in a conversation I'm having with someone who doesn't believe this number and I've googled everywhere and gotten different results.,0
"20 days, 120 lives in same 2020",0
How many of those were armed?,0
"They only know CONTROL, so when things are getting out of control they try to do the very same thing that got them in this predicament. They hope that fear is enough to get things under CONTROL.",0
"Police answer around 500,000 911 calls a day that's 10,000,000 in that time period alone. If we assume 1 quarter of them are violent calls thats 2,500,000 violent calls they respond to. 0.000048% that is the number of deaths in comparison to the number of violent calls.",0
"Fu*k me, but do you guys need better police.",0
"Which ever way you look at it, whatever side you believe, there is one thing that is glaringly obvious.
The current methods of policing do not work, and people, on both sides, are paying for it, with their lives.
",0
do you have a source for that? not doubting it at all just wondering where the number comes from,0
"If they are stealing and burning down stores they should die, more people have died in this riot than the police have killed in 6 YEARS",1
and how mean cop's have died since the  George Floyd ? how mean people have died since the  George Floyd ? your not talking about them .,1
4 cops have also been killed during that time frame.,1
Could you please give us some substantiation for this? Some sources?,0
??? shouldn‚Äôt it be life‚Ä¶,0
Glad to see Justice served. ,0
"Imagine R kelly was sentenced 30 years who didn't kill anyone, black lives matter",1
They gave him 21 cause his white and they gave R.Kelly 30 cause he's black. Justice for blacks,1
That‚Äôs not enough,0
so after 21 years george floyd will comeback to life?,0
Should‚Äôve been life smh he‚Äôll prolly get K1|_|_3|) in there tho,0
Not rap! But still a W!,0
not enough but it‚Äôs better than nothing,0
Unfortunately this doesn‚Äôt change anything. He wasn‚Äôt locked up when he killed him on the spot and after all these years now he‚Äôs been sentenced and for what? 21 years? That‚Äôs not nearly enough time.,0
But 30 years for R. Kelly for sexual allegations because he black?,1

"Considering the effect it had on the entire world, he should have got way more",0
Whilst Kelly got 30,1
Nah this is below the bar,0
Great piece of News... Finally justice has prevailed,0
And R.Kelly got 30yrs,1
"And they gave R kelly 30 years, 21 years is too small na",1
Floyd is getting justice at least but this is not enough,0
Yes! It should be for life tho,0
He will be out very soon...that much I know...,0
Whilst R. Kelly goes in for 30yrs,1
R Kelly got 30 smh,1
Should be 30+,0
Not even mad about this he not gonna last long in there anyway,0
ik bro is praying he don‚Äôt go to louisiana,0
but r kelly gets 30 years,1
don‚Äôt fall it black people stop voting and start in investing and learning,0
Just. 21 years,0
he got 41 for the people confused,0
In south Africa some have been discharged few days  back for the killing of an innocent civilian,0
Tis same type of punishment is what is suitable for ABBA Kyari of life sentence,1
"R kelly got more than that and he aint kill nobody. Thought we held ""Professionals"" to a higher degree",1
R.kelly 30 years and chauvin 21 years ,1
Why not eye for an eye,0
Less than R Kelly but he will be dead in maybe a year or two,1
That's a slap on the wrist,0
not the electric chair?,0
Death case for 21yrs ? Funny,0
Mfs really saying 21 years only and r Kelly got 30 bruh there completely different cases,1
This seems not enough for me but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs happening anyway. This is a way to start!,0
The kind of news I like to see. Black Lives Matter.,0
This title is a bit misleading. He was already convicted on state charges whereas this refers to the federal charges,0
R-Kelly didn't kill anyone yet he got more,1
Not enough! People got life for marijuana possession,0
"Is this justice unjust 
Or
The injustice is the justice ‚ùì

Involved in killing innocent person, 21yrs.

Involved in dealing with sex, 30yrs.",1

Why only 21?!?!?!? He should be in there FOR LIFE,0

U know what the killer of Floyd deserves his sentence. My black friends deserve this and more but this is not the end. Until all people recognize that we are all Americans this will not stop. Also until black Americans are brought up to full Americans this will continue,0
Absolutely but there needs to be more accountability for every single unnecessary death by cop.,0
"No they didn't. Chauvin will just appeal all the way up to the Republican Supreme Court, which will overturn the conviction based on Amy Coney Barrett's deciding vote.

What a disgusting tweet. No combat casualties since Feb 2020. Afghanistan hadn‚Äôt been a war since 2015. The only individuals that deserve any thanks out of this mess are the 13 fallen soldiers and the other brave members of the armed forces that remained there in the waining hrs,0

President Biden ended our 20 year nightmare that enriched Politicians and Military Contractors at the cost of the men and women in the US Military that sacrificed everything.,0

An older and experienced President who is not worried about his political future was finally the right man to make a difficult but correct decision!! He saved many American Service Members lives by finally pulling us out of that mess !,0

A black man arrested for the same crime with the same criminal record will get a slightly less severe sentence than a white man according to Obama doj statistics.  Unarmed whites are per capita and interaction more likely to get shot by cops. Behavior matters.,0
"Are we forgetting how Epstein got 18 months in jail, but was out in 13 as per his sweetheart deal? Oh and not to mention the dozens of minors he abused and trafficked all over the world in the course of years? The court made a white pedo look like a normal dude",0
If white privilege exists then why is the same thing happening to several other colors of skin? It's not about what color their skin is it matters on if they follow the law or not. Pull up your pants and accept the reality that just because of the color if your skin doesn't...,1
The one that pisses me off is about Ethan Couch who killed FOUR people because he was driving drunk and he got a light sentence because had ‚ÄúAffluenza‚Äù aka he grew up too rich to understand right from wrong. White privilege is real.,0
"Let us not forget that this systemic injustice is still around in our country today. Albert Wilson of Lawrence, Kansas got sentenced to 12+ years in prison for a ‚Äúhe-said she-said‚Äù rape over a white female. No semen, no evidence, just her word versus his. üòîüôèüèª",0
Remember when oj Simpson killed somebody and didn't go to jail it's all about money rich ppl get whatever they want no matter the color,0
"Paul Manafort hid $12 million from the IRS in blood money raided from the Ukrainian treasury given to him by his autocratic client, and he got a Get Out of Jail Free Card from Trump after serving less than half of his sentence.",0
Dylann Roof killed 9 people! Yet he‚Äôs still alive. Yeah white privilege is definitely real,0
Makes me think of that imprisoned black man  who‚Äôs been serving a life sentence since the 1980s for having stolen $9.,0
"If white privilage doesnt exist, then how did Brock Turner serve 3 months? How did Dylan Roof, after killing 9 people, get a bullet proof vest and a meal after getting arrested.
Why did those 2 white men get such but George Floyd get strangled while he said he couldnt breathe?",0
What about the Afluneza kid. Killed 4 people and the judge had to say something nice about him.,1
Comparing a ridiculously lenient prison sentence to the murder of a relatively innocent victim at the hands of a heavy handed cop and screaming ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù is typical of what is happening at the moment. You realise you‚Äôre diluting the issue with these absurd comparisons.,0
"It's not *just* white privilege, it's also wealth privilege.",0
Brock did not rape he ‚Äùfingered‚Äù during a drunken encounter and the judge followed sentencing guidelines. If you  don't like the law go  to California and change it. #FactCheck #FactsMatter,1
"That‚Äôs comparing apple too oranges though. You don‚Äôt know if george floyd would‚Äôve gotten sentenced too jail or not, so mentioning the time reduction is irrelevant. Plus cops are people and like people not everyone does thing properly like what happen too george floyd.",0
So Brock Turner represents all white people. Racism on steroids.,0
"White privilege is your excuse to undermine the seriousness of criminals. 
George Floyd died because he was a criminal, being held down on his neck by a criminal cop. Doesn‚Äôt matter the color you racist.

Black cops are significantly more likely to shoot a black man than a white cop per capita.  And while a white man is most likely to die from an accident a black man is most likely to die by another black man.  But of course this is all about evil white men somehow. Yes douche cop,1
How many black convicts were let out of jail early because of covid.,1
They will.  Now how about you get your constituents to stop rioting?,1
This needs to start at the top too. In police academy they need to train them against racism.,0
"No, he wasn't.

George Floyd died because of his own actions and inability to properly  handle police interactions.

He wasn't ""murdered"". He died as a result of poor health and lifestyle choices (see coroner's report).

What the cop did was wrong, however, he was not 'murdered'",0
Why didn‚Äôt you hold cops accountable in California?,1
You didn‚Äôt say that when Mitrice Richardson was murdered by police. https://latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-mitrice-richardson-closed-20170202-story.html,1
So all due process and blind justice is out the window? Let's wait to see all the facts and what happens at trial.,0

Both are crimes.",0
"
Thank you. Now do the officer involved murders in California.",1
"Where was this energy when you were declining to prosecute murderous cops in California? ""Harris also rejected pleas by civil rights activists to investigate deadly police shootings of young black men in Los Angeles and San Francisco.""",1
You also need to be held accountable for Black people you imprisoned who were innocent,1
"Why did you think otherwise when it was within your power to make those decisions to hold police accountable?

What changed Kamala Harris? Besides your ambition?

"When you were DA and later AG, you did not hold killer please officers accountable. Are you back to dirty prosecutor who falsified a confession. You were supposed to state wide body cameras. Just stop.",1
Just like every protestor should be held liable for the shop owners and civilians who have been savagely beaten ?,1
Yep. They will and who will be held accountable for the rioting? Who will rebuild the cities destroyed? I say let the cities fend for themselves with no Federal assistance. Many Democrats are on the wrong side.,1
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Trump invited the Taliban to Camp David.,1

"Lauren, I'm old enough to remember when you decided to stay with a man who displayed his adult genitals to underage girls.

Yeah? Well I'm old enough to remember that Donald Trump was responsible for killing 1.1M Americans because he was too narcissistic to wear a mask and was angry that people liked Dr. Fauci more than him and so he told people to drink bleach and lied to everyone about the pandemic.‚Ä¶,1

"#trump made deal with #Afghanistan to release 5000 #taliban fighters and drew down #USA troops in a VERY quick manner that left equipment behind AFTER he lost the election

This was NOT a #JoeBiden failure, this was #trump sabotaging him",0

Trump got MBS and Putin to cut oil supplies to help oil companies,0

Did it surprise anyone when Obama swapped five Taliban terrorists for an Army deserter?,1
"This as opposed to the Trump which left him in prison for 2 years, didn‚Äôt get him or fellow veteran Trevor Reed out and made a deal with the Taliban to let thousands of hardened fighters back on to the battlefield, many of which are now senior leaders in the Taliban Government",1
He was not a Marine. He was drummed out after a criminal conviction following a court marshall. He was a clerk when he was active.,1
It surprises me more than trump leaving that same marine behind. Trump did nothing for 2 years.,0
"This man had a bad conduct discharge. He faced court martial and was convicted. Still, negotiations are ongoing. All this disinformation does is hurt the Whelan family",0
He wasn‚Äôt a marine. He was dishonorably discharged. And trump left him behind - wouldn‚Äôt make a deal for his release per John Bolton.,0
What did the previous administration do to help the marine?,1
"Uh, if you bothered to/ were competent to check actual history ( not your fantasies) you would find that Trump initiated Afghanistan pull out.",1
"What did trump do for the two years that Marine was jailed by his friend Putin? Trump never even mentioned his name.

Trump released 5,000 Taliban for zero marines.",1

I was surprised he's that's gone - looks like a China clone to me.,0
"You do realize Trump had two years to try to get Paul Whelan freed, right?

Also Putin refuses to deal on Paul Whelan cuz he was convicted of spying. It was Grier or no one. 

But you don‚Äôt care about truth, do you?",0
"No, he‚Äôs a Chinese at heart communist!",0
He would j Ave left his mother if he could profit from it.,0
Not in the slightest.  Totally expected.,0
Does it surprise you that Trump tried and FAILED?,0
"The family is choosing not to begrudge her her freedom. ‚ÄúPaul Whelan's brother David called accepting the deal to release Brittney Griner the ""right decision"" rather than ""waiting for one that wasn't going to happen.""  But other statements particularly by the Marine implies (1)
",0
"Dishonorable discharge is NOT a Marine, and Trumpy Dumpty had two years. He released 5000 taliban terrorists instead.",1
So when Trump left him behind in 2018-2020 did you say anything then?,1
Biden got the legit military man back. Trump left the guy you all care so much about now.  Quit pretending,0
Trump left Whelan behind for two years. Passed on an opportunity to get him released. Trump doesn‚Äôt give a damn about Paul Whelan,1
"The Marine the Former Guy, Trump, never mentioned once nor did anything for when he was in power but instead saluted Kim Jong, kissed Putins ass and released 5,000 Taliban in returned for NOTHING? Yeah, I think I would take Biden over TFG. TFG only cares for himself.",1
What Marine is he leaving behind? Paul Whelan lost that title a long time ago due to his disgraceful criminal conduct while serving.,0
Nope don‚Äôt surprise me at all. Biden sucks!!!,0
"Trump left the same marine behind, no room in your brain for that simple fact ? And , the Afghanistan mess was left in Biden‚Äôs lap. I can‚Äôt imagine it helped that trump pardoned and released  5000 taliban prisoners.",1
"Kind of like how Trump abandoned an ally and left the Kurds to be slaughtered? Even the American military that was there felt bad for abandoning them, because they fought and died alongside Americans.",1
