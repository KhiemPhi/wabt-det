"One way to end this war is if no one shows up to fight Ukrainians. Good guess that roughly 1% of the Russian population is now engaged in this war (front lines plus support behind them might be 1.5 million). With 15,000 dead (1% of those engaged) and likely 3 times more seriously injured, every Russian engaged in this war knows more than one person who is dead or injured. As long as Ukrainians continue inflicting casualties, at some point Russians will expect to die or get injured. Between this and lack of funds, Putin could possibly run out of people willing to commit war crimes for him. We should make it really easy for Russians of military age to leave Russia.",0

"The problem with not doing sanctions that hit the average person, is that they are often times the same type of sanctions necessary to cripple a military. It's absolutely awful what these sanctions will do to average Russian people. But unfortunately, the west is going with an ""everything we can do, we will do"" policy to first and foremost, not enter into the war, and secondly to aid Ukraine in the crisis of this war. I hope the second these sanctions can be lifted that they are. But if Russia continues, i say keep the dials out of their favor. For every Russian going through dire straits economically (or worse. they were conscripted and are now dead because of an unjust action from a few rich oligarchs, and Putin.), some Ukrainian had their home bombed. There is no economic recovery for the dead.",1

"They don't even have the economy of CANADA!!! The GDP of Russia is INFERIOR to ours. The ONLY reason they can field a 300,000 strong military, is by giving the population PEANUTS and using mostly OLD weapon systems and an underpaid conscript army. The professionals get the better systems, but those systems are RARE and once they are gone, it's over... As far as their military is concerned, if you take away the Nukes, they are like Iraq, when the Allies went for the FIRST Gulf war. They are HUGE, filled with tanks and arty and jets... But WAY underclassed, in fighting doctrine AND in equipment quality. Quantity DOES have a quality of its own. But past a certain adversarial technological advantage, it becomes a junkyard filled with corpses and twisted metal. 
EVERYBODY was afraid of the NUMBERS... Of the Cold war SOVIET threat and how much it was respected and feared... BULL!!! I would have thought that the 1990 war would have at LEAST shown that much to the Russians... Numbers don't mean SHIAT against more modern foes. Those anti-tank missiles and low-level AA stingers ARE exchanging 80,000$ - 200,000$ missiles, for 2 Million$ Tanks or 15 Million$ Ka-52M Attack choppers. Look at what a mostly infantry force can do to a combined arms army. Just in the last 18 days, they destroyed more Russian equipment than the US lost in the last 20 years in the middle-east. With better AA for High altitude defense and MORE missiles to take out the armor, PLUS counterfire radars and systems that can REACH the Russian arty positions, Ukraine wins this in a week. 
IF Putin wasn't crazy enough to use chemical weapons. What NATO should say to Putin, is that as SOON as the SOURCE that launches any Chemical attack is localized, THAT will be destroyed. PERIOD... Just THAT unit.. Any interference means a full-on assault by NATO. It's about TIME we put that crazy mafia don OUT of commission before he does us all in. Not every Russian big-shot wants a Russian empire or hates the West. The NEXT leader could be a lot better. 
The ONLY reason why Russia is scary, is because of the Nukes. Otherwise, it's just a backwater country that sees its people like cannon fodder and slaves.",0

"We (Americans) should have made it VERY clear to Russia that Ukraine was to be off limits BEFORE they invaded. Also, Putin must have thought that we would not want another war after Afghanistan, just how we didn't want a WW2 after a WW1. If our country's citizens actually stood by freedom instead of just preaching it, this war would not have happened. That's what would have deterred Putin. By stating that we would not be sending troops to Ukraine & thus not being strategically ambiguous, & by appeasing to Putin after the annexation of Crimea, the government AND the citizenry, gave Putin & Lukashenko the green light, just like we did to Hitler before WW2. Same goes for Taiwan.",0

"It's time for us to give him a powerful ultimatum. A date to get out of Ukraine. The time has come, everyone sees how weak he is.",0
Does this mean that someone in the Kremlin has the courage to tell Putin the truth?,0
If Ukraine gives up their military it's all over for them. Territory concessions maybe but that's it.,0
Unless Russia backs out and returns ALL territories including Crimea and Luhansk and Donbas and lets Ukraine decide its own allegiance they shouldn't even bother to get on the negotiations table.,0
"Thank you Ukraine for holding up to the Russian army which has 80% of Putin‚Äôs army surrounding your country. Your efforts Ukraine, have greatly diminished and exposed Putin‚Äôs military might.  That‚Äôs why Putin is calling for China‚Äôs help",0
"Keep in mind that there's a big difference between what Russia deserves and what Russia can reasonably be expected to agree to. This guy is talking about the latter.
I think it's entirely feasible for Ukraine, with as much help as NATO can provide without becoming combatants,  to make this invasion so costly that Russia will decide to back out.
However, getting Russia to accept punishments as severe as it deserves would require defeating and conquring it, at least as thoroughly as we did to Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II. Even if we could somehow ensure that the war didn't go nuclear, the damage and death toll would be at least as large as it was for WWII. For everyone who's outraged about the possibility that Russia won't get the punishment that it deserves, ask yourself ""am I willing to pay a price that high for vengeance?"".",0

"I would just like to congratulate the Russian forces. They have lost 3 major generals one general and 5 colonels fighting bravely. Now normally there are on average 1,400 regular troops to one general and 100 troops to one colonel. So we would expect the above looses to equate to Russian troop deaths to over 6,000 soldiers. However Moscow has informed us that only 500 troops have been lost. As we know Moscow never lies we must assume that instead of normally sending cannon fodder to their deaths, that Moscow has put all those generals and colonels in the front line to die instead. Well Done Russia (for those whose first language is not English please read the definition of sarcasm)",0

"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ‚ÄúThe teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses‚Äô seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô by others.

But you are not to be called ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather,‚Äô for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their sins,
your Father will not forgive your sins.

Yet a time is coming and has now come
when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.

In the New Heaven and the New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.

"History shows that sieges are extraordinarily expensive both in manpower and material.  Ukrainian supply lines have not been sufficiently cut off; if this report is accurate, then Putin has lost the initiative.  I really hope Ukraine pulls this off and is able to break out with counter-offensives, as I don't see any evidence that Putin has the stomach for a prolonged siege of any major city.  Fronts appear to have become static, which has given ample time for Ukrainian armed forces to dig in, mine and fortify their positions.  Taking Kiev will break the Russian army, attrition will be their end as the West pours men and material into Ukraine, by proxy of course ;-)",0
"Those saying that Russia can't stop or lose face with the world.... Russia lost its face in the first week. They're desperate now, having failed to take a single city by military action in 3 weeks. The only city captured surrendered without a fight.  Russia is losing in Ukraine and they lose more of Russia every day they are there. China has refused to throw them a lifeline and they're sinking fast. I imagine Putin will be ""retired"" within weeks",0
"Due to the thousands of NLAW and Javelin rockets in Kyiv now, Russian convoys are getting ambushed every time they come close to Kyiv. Ukrainians don‚Äôt have to completely destroy Russian vehicles. They just have to damage enough Russian resources so that a Kyiv siege is impossible.",0

In contrast, 20% of the Ukrainian territory, which Russia heavily attacks with bombardments ruining everything and everyone, is a heavily inhabited areas, where live about 10-15 millions people.
The Ukrainian Army does everything to protect people, but in this way loses essential its country, as the areas giving energy, food, water, connections between the cities are occupied by Russians.
Essentially, Russians purge the Ukrainian population, while seizing the Ukrainian land and economic resources. Seeing such events happening in the middle of Europe in the XXI century seems like the worst nightmare.",0

It is a glacier, moving by mass of people and destructive power.
That means it must have strong supply lines to keep pushing in people and ordinance.",0

"I always thought Russia had a much stronger, more organized military. I guess I‚Äôm used to the total shock and awe of America‚Äôs military might.",0
"A good strategy for Russia in this war would have been to have prepared good amount of long range attack drones, take out the air defenses in the initial phase with overwhelming air strikes and cruise missiles attacks, hunt down Ukrainian aircraft and destroy them  before any Russian soldier sets foot on Ukraine territory. Then they would have transitioned to drone warfare to support ground forces thereby reducing aircraft and pilot losses. This would have also made the entire operation sustainable in terms of costs and Ukrainian infantry equipped with Javelin and small anti air missiles would constantly be hunted down. Unfortunately Russia still relies on old fashioned military tactics of using jets and attack helicopters to fight an asymmetric warfare. In the end they might be forced to use chemical weapons and tactical warheads to force Ukraine to capitulate. This would spell disaster as the Russian military would lose their credibility to fight and win against lesser opponents never mind against superior enemy like NATO.",0

I don‚Äôt know much about military operations in past history or much about what is said in the Bible about what we are seeing happening with Ukraine and Russia. But I feel like this decision made by Russia to invade another country that has been long brewing and in the making for years does anyone feel like Russia Isn‚Äôt just gonna stop with Ukraine?? There appears to be a much bigger plan Russia has in store for the rest of the world and china seems to be on their side which is very unsettling. Russia invaded Ukraine appears based on maps they showed us in a very odd way and also wondered was it cuz of how the environment is over there or were they worried about other neighboring country‚Äôs getting involved as well cuz this takeover over Ukraine seems to be purposeful long and chess like planned out or I like to believe the power and the spirit of the one and only our father God has been doing his works slowing down the evil we are seeing such as reports of missiles disappearing and the Russians running out of gas. Thoughts or prayers anyone??,0

Man I wish I was there to tackle the officer to save George Floyd üòû,0
"And by the way those ex-cops will meet some ""friends"" in prison....",1
The way he pleaded for his life sends chills through my body.,0

Where's the outrage about all the killing of the BLACK BABIES???,1
"This made me very angry and emotional to watch but I feel like destroying things and rioting doesn‚Äôt make things better, it just causes civilians to be put in dangerous circumstances as well as local communities to be in shambles. We need to find a way to voice our opinions without violence when it isn‚Äôt necessary.",1
no need to be a cop just enough to be human,0
The news forgot to mention the part about him being completely strung out on Fentanyl which led to this whole event happening,1
Don‚Äôt even sentence him to death. Just throw him in prison. He‚Äôll be dead in a week,0

"Interesting how CBS Evening News lies in this youtube video description under the video. It says four white officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been fired. That is false, one of the four officers fired is of asian descent, one is mixed black/asian descent, and the other 2 are white. More fake news.",1
At the end the reporter looks like he is standing in front of a green screen.,0
"If he was already in handcuffs, there's no need to pin him down by his neck. Makes no sense.",0

"When he said he couldn't breathe, he pressed his knee down harder. That man is sickening.",0
"More fake news from CBS. Might want to show the entire video you‚Äôve had for sometime now. Lester holt admitted that NBC has had the real body cam footage for months. This guy was high on fentanyl if not selling it. He had 4x the lethal limit in his system, so he probably swallowed it and is in the process of overdosing. That‚Äôs why he says he can‚Äôt breathe immediately after being pulled out of his vehicle by officers. Respiratory failure was imminent with that amount of fentanyl, he was a dead man walking.",1
"That back door of the police car, being left open, seems to be used as a partial ""blind"" to cover the actions of the police officers. Was that its purpose?",0
"Look how he rolls him over, damn near breaking his arms after he killed himüòî",0
I‚Äôm happy they took all 4cops to jail,0
This doesn‚Äôt even need an investigation! JUST ARREST HIM,0

"I felt everything you said. I have experienced this from an early age. I can remember being in the 1st grade and the teacher asked all of us what we wanted to be when we grew up. I said I wanted to be the president of the world. The teacher and the class laughed at me and one boy shouted out,"" You can't be president, your black."" The teacher didn't object to his statement. This happened in 1979. The teacher was old then, I wish she lived to see Obama become president. I am a teacher now and it embarrasses me that she was a part of our occupation. Complete disregard for a young boy's elevated aspirations. I have never gone to jail, but my skin has allowed me the opportunity to ""interact"" with the police many times.",0

1. Dylann, a white Supremacist, shot up a church (reloaded several times) & kills about 10 people (old and young ). 
Cops arrest, no bodily harm , no excessive force, and even bought a burger for him. He got pure decency and a burger, after committing cold blooded murder!

2. George, a black guy in a car never killed anyone but currently suspected of a crime, cops suffocated him to death even when he wasn't resisting nor armed. 
He got brutally killed on suspicion of a crime (and no it wasn't murder).

Why was one treated like a human being in spite of a heinous crime, while the other was treated less than an animal on suspicion of a crime",0
"I just want to say this monologue was inspiring and powerful. I've shared it with family and friends, all white, and have been amazed at the response and empathy that it has garnered. It's been re-shared throughout our social circles and it has changed minds. My grandmother, who is supremely old-school had shivers and tears. Trevor, your talent for speaking helped people understand the need for the protests, the need for reform, and got people to understand the privilege they enjoy in a way I have never witnessed before.

"Trevor is so articulate and deliberate in what he says. While I love and appreciate #StephenColbert #JimmyKimmel #SethMeyers #JamesCordon, as they genuinely empathize with this movement, Trevor can speak to it from a perspective they cannot... heck, most of cannot ... as an outsider, an insider, and an Apartheid South African. So much respect.",0
You should make speaches im crying inside your just stating the facts but the eloquent way you put it states it very well. .. thank you.,0
"Thank-you, Trevor for a brilliantly considered message. I am a fan, and I am a white guy; 60 something. I remember the civil rights movement, I remember the riots ...almost everywhere at one time or another; Chicago, 1969 comes to mind. I remember the murder of Martin Luther King. At he age of 13, I was already wondering; what is going on here? 
One of my ""jobs"" is to deliver worship services to small, white, dying Protestant congregations in upstate, rurul New York. These Christian Congregations have been at it all of their lives, and they get it, but are shielded from the real clash. In my most recent message I talked about connecting the dots; the dominoes. And, then, to hear you talk about it brought tears to my eyes. You, and many of the other night show hosts, are our modern philosophers; keep doing what you do.",0

It can't treat one group differently from another.‚Äù",0
"Mind-blowingly insightful; Trevor's insight here and connecting the dots to the bigger picture of how society ""works"" should make us all sit up, take notice, and most importantly, change how we see the world and how we act in it.

Not one minute after I entered the construction firm's office, the man who was to interview me said, ""I asked for a Secretary and they send me This!"" My ears became hot and my throat dry. He said nothing else, nor proceeded with the interview. I left immediately. I believe that people have had/do experience incidents like mine and you move on, forward.

Those that say ""all lives matter"" in response to Black Lives Matter, is like a neighborhood, with varying race households, and a household of a black family is burning, and was targeted for being a black household, and they say, rightfully, ""help! Our house is burning, Black Houses Matter too! Please!"" And someone responds ""all households matter!"" But it isn't about you, it isn't about your house, your house isn't burning, your house wasn't targeted. That's what it looks like when someone acts as if Black Lives Matter is something against them. The house is burning and we must band together and put it out, they are our neighbors and deserve compassion to help bring our neighborhood together. We must fix this problem. Love thy neighbor.",0

So injustice excuses injustice towards other innocent people..even people of your own comunity.. good message Trevor,0
I‚Äôve never had it explained this way. I‚Äôve always thought I understood what racism felt like - understanding as much as was possible as an average white lady. I‚Äôm the one to speak up when seeing/hearing racism. But Today I am humbled. The point Trevor made - think about WHO oppresses you and how that makes you feel- was a HUGE ah-ha for me. I get it now. The undercurrent of anger. The constantly being told and SHOWN you are lesser than when you are not. Wow.

"Perfectly articulated. I know it‚Äôs been well-articulated so many, many, many times before but thank god this time - this excellent summary - may be heard in ways it hasn‚Äôt and the asleep collective may awaken and begin to heal the traumas perpetrated by systemic injustice resulting in unimaginable horrors day in and day out.",0

It only becomes racist when the Antifa start attacking them and pushing their buttons. Everyone has the right to be proud of their race.

The WONDERFUL northern General, Grant, well, his statues still stand, but he refused to free his slaves. Invented the saying, ""Good help is hard to find"" when asked why he didnt free them...",0

"Supremacists. I harbor hate for almost nothing. Except supremacists. They are the essence of all that is ugly within the human heart. No different than ISIS or Nazis in my opinion. Having said this, I am not convinced of the wisdom of removing these so-called ""confederate"" monuments. A people that forgets their history is doomed to repeat it.",0

"Posters here are a prime example of why it's so easy to recruit extremists willing to kill Americans. They reveal a hypocrisy in our so-called acceptance of different religious and ethnic backgrounds. Our so-called belief that everyone is equal under the law. Yet, protesters that are intentionally ran over by a white extremist is applauded by so many. Not even the President will denounce the act of this White Extremist movement. Simply stating all sides are wrong. I'm sure the ""Islamic Extremists"" are laughing and pointing their fingers saying ""I told you so."" They can now say, if Americans care so little about each other, what makes you think they care about Muslims being killed in bombing raids across the globe?",0
"Everyone at that demonstration is responsible for this tragedy. They all hate each other's races, beliefs, etc. President Trump called it correctly in his press briefing. Everyone out doing this are rats and want to cause trouble. Be it white nationalists, blm, pussy hats, students, etc. The one difference I've noticed is that the msm is condemning the white people and identifying them as white supremacy supporters and so on. Everyone else is a ""counter protester"". They did not do this when reporting on blm and other racist, hater groups. So, as always, the msm is pouring as much fuel on the fire as they can. Assholes. All.",0
