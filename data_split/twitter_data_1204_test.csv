"Since the 2014 coup, Ukraine had more antisemitic attacks than all former URSS countries combined, erected hundreds of statues to Nazi collaborators, approved policies against its russian/pole/hungarian minorities, banning the languages in the public sector and service industry.",1
That's why Bandera is a national hero in Ukraine.,1
What about the Azov Battalion?,1
Cool but what about the Ukrainian government's efforts to ban the Bulgarian language and the constant abuse our minorities faced in your country? when will you apologise to all of us for your country's wrongdoings towards us?,1

Do you notice no one agrees with you and you truly bring nothing to the conversation.,0
"Yes, and the founder was fortunate enough to buy herself a FEW MANSIONS. ONE EVEN IN CANADA. Makes American corporations very proud.",1

BLM- Brutal Lying Murderers,0
"Riots that took place in many cities across 100+ days and included targeting normal people/burning down their shops, sieging an unrelated courthouse and killing 30+ people will inevitably lead to more arrests than a single day of unrest largely centered in a single city",0
Certainly. Far too many. There should not have been one arrest in my opinion. The people should never have allowed it. The authority of the people has been seriously compromised.,0

 that there were 10K insurrectionists at Capitol today.",0

I am sure the 4100 Americans stuck there with with less than 7 days to get out would disagree.,0
"Yes. The fact that this hasn't ended on the wholesale massacre of US civilians and Afghan allies has been due to chance, not effective leadership. Many SIV applicants are still going to be killed. The withdrawal being a good idea, and the execution of it are different things.",0

But we know you would defend him no matter what happens because ‚Äúanything but trump‚Äù,0
It‚Äôs bad because of the millions who will suffer under Taliban rule,0
Does the Taliban still threaten Afghanistan? Is every translator who worked with us out? Is everyone seeking asylum out?,0
"Well when you highlight the only 2 positives and completely leave out the fact that now a country is under Taliban rule, much like ISIS controlled Syria and Iraq. Which means we're gonna have to go back and have a new war. Roll on military industrial complex!",0
it's bad because of the way the US left the country. On top of that the last 20 years proving to have been for absolutely nothing with the swift Taliban takeover. Leaving Afghanistan doesn't mean it has to be in such a terrible and chaotic way.,0
"I respect u, but your analysis of Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan is so simplistic & biased. Biden handed a country over to a 15th cent. religious extremist terrorist group. No hope for girls to have a future anymore, no rights for minorities anymore etc. U call this success?",0
You lie with such confidence and ease because you know your fellow cult members are small minded enough to believe every word.,0
Marge is a confederate soldier not an American public servant. She has taken over Congress and wants to destroy the nation from inside. She admits it. Her public agenda is reinstalling a criminal traitor she‚Äôs obstructing justice for and breaking up the United States of America,0
"Congresswoman, you do realize that no one is buying what your selling right? You are accusing not only a sitting President of leaving American equipment behind (which actually belonged to the Afghans) your accusing our troops of gross negligence as well. Leaving equipment behind in a combat zone is a crime ma‚Äôam and no President can give an unlawful order to do so because, no brother or sister of mine who‚Äôs been to combat would follow that order.",0
"Once again disinformation trumps facts Madge. What exactly are you paid for if you can‚Äôt do some basic research?

From AP:

The $85 billion figure resembles a number from a July 30 quarterly report from SIGAR, which outlined that the U.S. has invested about $83 billion to build, train and equip Afghan security forces since 2001‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¶funding included troop pay, training, operations and infrastructure along with equipment and transportation over two decades. only about $18 billion of that sum went toward equipping Afghan forces between 2002 and 2018, a June 2019 SIGAR report showed.

If you take into account obsolescence (look that one up Madge) and the cost of transportation back to the US of out of date hardware your statement as one has come to expect is a joke.

You really are the poster girl for stupid bring the new smart in the Republican Party.

Just to close, it was Trump and Pompeo who surrendered Afghanistan back to the Taliban and released 5000 Taliban as a going away present. Throwing afghan women under the bus and slow walking SIVs for Afghan interpreters and those that helped Americans at the risk of retribution.

Time once again to sit down and be quiet.",0
Yes impeach him !!!,0

Where are John Fetterman, Mitch McConnell and Diane Feinstein?  
Mitch hasn‚Äôt tweeted in almost a month.

"Joe Biden thought it was more important to get people out of Afghanistan than equipment rendered useless, Marjorie.",0
I know you‚Äôve heard this but maybe you didn‚Äôt understand. That equipment was done. It wasn‚Äôt going to run much longer. What would be the point of spending the time and money to ship them back here?,0
"Nice TRY 
@MTG
, it was all disable and rendered USELESS LIKE YOU!!! MAYBE if TRUMP had not made a dead line deal with the Taliban and Biden had to hurry to make that deadline he could of gotten it out but your guy made a deal with the DEVIL and REFUSED to even inform Biden!!!!",0
Try and impeach and see what happens.,0
"You don‚Äôt know anything about military procedures. 

You also leave out the context of being rushed out of Afghanistan after your fearless leader set a timetable with no plan for accomplishing troop withdrawal.

Didn't Joe Biden make a side deal with the taliban?,0
What‚Äôs the status of that impeachment?,0
Joe must think they need a strong military to defend their borders,0
"WRONG!!!! Stop spreading lies!!! It is well documented by the department of defense and other sources which you have readily available to you as you are a congresswoman, that $85 billion was the total of money spent on the war from 2005-2021 not the equipment left behind!",0
"While the situation in Afghanistan is indeed regrettable, it is important to focus on solutions rather than casting blame. We must work together to ensure that the Afghan people are safe and secure, and that the region does not become a breeding ground for terrorism. Let us unite in this effort and move forward.",0
And when Ford pulled our troops from Vietnam. He did it in just 18 days!! All equipment brought back and all personal!! No one was left behind!!,0
Biden should be charged for the total production cost of the materials at the very least.,0
He also left rooms full of bundles of 100 dollar bills.,0
If mtg studied even a little bit she would know this happens after all wars. It is not worth the cost to bring non-confidential  equipment  home.,0

You said NOTHING ",1
"You mean of Biden withdrawing from Afghanistan based on Trump's plan? If he hadn't withdrawn, you'd be squawking about that as well.",1
The Taliban is just the conservative ruling party of Afghanistan.  You should recognize the many similarities with your Party.,0

Remind me who did the awful deal with the Taliban and left out the Afghan government?,1

Did you want the war to continue? Is that what you‚Äôre asking now? What‚Äôs your point if you have any?,0
"Trump surrendered to the Taliban and set withdrawal time tables . Stop lying .

Then invited them to Camp David to celebrate 9/11.",1

"You meant to say ‚Äútrump‚Äù. Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he was concerned that Trump ""undermined"" the US' 2020 agreement with the Taliban by pushing for US forces to leave Afghanistan without the Taliban meeting the conditions of the deal.",1

I had no idea he was pulling strings behind the scenes during Trump's Presidency.",0

"And, yet, who released the Taliban and their leaders? Why don‚Äôt you remind the nation, Marsha? 

Speak up! 

You‚Äôre a loud-mouthed lying propagandist and it‚Äôs time you tell the truth.",1
"Perhaps Trump shouldn't have withdrawn U.S. troops from Afghanistan AFTER he lost the election. 
Also, Trump shouldn't have released 5,000 Taliban fighters, outnumbering troops 2-1.

Reminder: Marsha Blackburn was SILENT about Trump's actions, & she acquitted Trump ... TWICE.",1
"As you're the ones who surrendered to the Taliban, perhaps you ought to shut it about debacles in Afghanistan.",1

"Afghanistan women are in talks with the Taliban to promote education for girls. Afghanistan lost a billion dollars from not allowing women in the workforce,",0
"How easy it is for you, Marsha, to just lie! Did I miss your tweet celebrating the Talaban at Camp David?",1
So no problem with Trump releasing those 5000 Taliban then Marsha?,1
Have you forgotten that it was Donald Trump who ordered the release of 5000 Taliban?,1
The taliban leader trump negotiated the release of? That taliban leader?,1
The debacle that President Trump negotiated with the terrorist Taliban you mean? Do you really think we do not know who wanted them invited to Camp David to create a spectacle@ of signing an accord? This is all on Trump!,1
The zero degree temps we had killed my shrubs‚Ä¶Joe Biden and his radical socialist agenda is responsible üôÑ,1
You mean the one where trump surrendered to the Taliban?,1
Do you see how efficiently MAGA uses the US standing up to Putin as a wedge to campaign against Biden? Do you see how closely aligned trump and Putin‚Äôs interests are? And how they have been since putin illegally helped trump take power in 2016?,0
Before or after he unveils his health care plan?,1
"Correct. He'll pull the US out of Europe and stop supplying Ukraine with weapons. Ukraine will be defenseless. That will definitely end the war. For the Russians, this means Ukraine will join Russia.",0
