Russia bombing buildings four miles from Kyiv's center doesn't sound like losing. How close have the Ukrainians gotten to Moscow?,1
For 20yrs people was asking what's going on with war in Afghanistan but you have major coverage of a war that don't impact American Soldiers! Why?,1
Can any of you tell us about the tragedy in Donetsk today? Civilians of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were killed by a rocket! Or close your eyes too?,1

Awesome.",0
Russia is relentless. I feel sorry for the Ukrainian civilians who are caught in this nasty game.,0
Are we sure this isnt plan C or D at this point?,0

"An easier way for putting to speed things up and cement his takeover will be if once cities are taken, that he identify Russians and Ukrainians on Russia's side and arm them to serve as auxiliaries to Russian troops to maintain was has been taken and prevent his troops from thinning out as they move from city to city, while also taking Ukrainian equipment and vehicles for auxiliary units.",0
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦,0
"Ashish Joshi made a little mistake during the announcement. He used the word ""invasion"", while it is a Special military Operation. Also they mention plan B, Like Sky News knew what plan A was.",0
"What russia has caused to the Ukrainian people will never be erased , Russias president is a dictator and his fall will happen may not be now but he's time will come . Hope for the brave Ukrainians that are in the battlefield today 🙏",0
Kyiv is not the goal. It's just a bonus. The goal is likely to capture the East and South and separate it from Ukraine permanently. Odessa region is certainly a target.,0
One of the better analysis I have seen. Many others just keep blabbing on.,0
The best move NATO and the Wet could make right now. Move very large  Navy and ground forces to the black sea and Gulf of Finland area. That would send him a serious message.,0
"Its a giant pincher movement. Look at WWII, the Russians, and the Germans deployed these moves. Always outstretching their supplies. Then it became fatal.",0
"All this “Russia being halted” thinking is good and all but what is the Ukrainian plan to relieve the besieged cities? Clearly they do not have the Air Force or armor (tanks) needed to mount any serious counter offensives. Cities like Mariupol , Kharkiv and soon Odessa will be starved out.",0
I am curious if the Ukrainian army is well trained and commanded enough to quickly withdraw from the east of the country and attack the Russians besieging Mariupol ?,0
Stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians ♥♥♥,0
Why are everyone saying Russia is taking a beating? We’re at the 3th week and they’ve already taken over almost all of south Ukraine and soon north. How long did it take USA to take over Afghanistan? 20 years?,1
Russia is taking a major blow here.  Even without sanctions it will cost a lot to replace their military equipment!,0
The goal was to secure the secluded portion of the Black Sea,0
Now I understand why russia looked like an octopus in some maps. They are always stealing land piece by piece with their sticky tentacles.,0
"If Putin withdraws from the Ukraine leaving it in shambles, the sanctions should not be lifted until Russia pays for Ukraine's complete  recovery and reparations are made. In addition, Ukraine should be allowed into NATO and the European Union.",0
19 days must have felt like two decades to the Ukrainians...,0
"We're not going to stop re-supplying, more likely to install more anti missile batteries :-)",0
3 weeks and the supposedly 2nd strongest military on Earth can't make into Kyiv. Not very impressed......,0
"I feel like I'm being terrorised, and I'm in Australia. I suppose there aren't any suggestions for solutions? ... For example, where can I find intelligent people to talk with and they not be communistic like  or authoritarian like in their approach?

I'm not employed and I have diagnosed medical conditions, which have been physically exacerbated ... I don't appreciate being pushed towards womens shelters as a solution, when it is a family matter ... how can I get through to .... ?",0
In what places is the Ukrainian army organizing ambushes? From places marked as military areas or places where civilians live? Stop this talk about civilian residences - these are the battlefields! Remember how was pacified Iraq - for example Battle of Fallujah,0
Genghis khan was a absolute master at the slow starve out method. Just surround and cut off all incoming and outgoing and wait.,0

So according to Sky News there has been little Russian advancement in the past 2 weeks. Surely this can’t be true?,0
At least now that Britain has dropped it industrial sector (no more despicable working class and no more dirty dirt) the Henry's can swing a good handbag or two!,0

Mariupol defenders - what a defense. We need a movie about Mariupol defense in the future.,0
This expert is pro ukrain so it’s not fair. Bring a neutral expert.,0
Ukraine should of put small teams of Javelin units throughout whole country.,0

Thank you for articulating what I couldn't say...,0

"So true Trevor, so true. Perfectly articulated given the subject.",0
A CNN reporter was arrested BEFORE the officer that killed George Floyd was.,1
"Some ppl just can’t seem to get past the “is looting right or wrong” and “what can looting accomplish” questions. They tend to overly emphasize on cause and effect, reductionist, linear and absolutist way of thinking. They believe there is a clear right and wrong and means never justify ends. They will probably hate the mention of dominos effect because that implies the impact random luck and chance have on the development of events and that will prompt them to resort to volition/self sovereignty/free will/self determination ideological defense.

When dealing with dynamically complex social issue, it would not hurt to leverage more holistic, relative truth way of thinking that examines events at high lvl of details and resist the urge to downplay the complexity of situation.",0
"Thank you Trevor for your words of wisdom. From my perspective racism is anti christian . It goes against everything Jesus preached. Taking the life of a person is anti christian. We often criticize the looting , While I don't condone looting., I don't condone what has happened. I feel there is a lot hypocrisy at the top. We must hold accountable those responsible . The social contract is for all no exeptions.",0
Thank God for Trevor Noah.... I love this man,0
This man said what I wanted to say so eloquently!!!,0
"Enlightened man. Trevor was born and raised during Apartheid and its after effects. He tells stories of his mother and father having to walk separately on the sidewalks. He understands oppression. He understands its effect, as a cancer of the soul. Excellent analysis and explanation. Hats off. Sir, you are a true gem.",0
"THANK YOU for saying this, so calmly and succinctly. Appreciate your humor and show, but also your wisdom and stewardship.",0
"Wow, I like how this has opened my perspective of society and upholding etiquette for ideals that do not justly serve all parties involved. There are many of us who have felt the affects of racism from police in America and I feel better when I am able to stop judging myself for wanting to stand in opposition to the social climates that foster the violations.",0
"Full ""Leaked"" body cam video of george floyd is out. go watch it and see if it changes your opinion. The full video is 8 minutes long, not the 2minute version that mainstream media clipped. Don't let the mainstream media brain wash you to their agenda! Think for yourself!",1

I'm only surprised it took this long.",0
Beautifully explained! Trevor you're an amazing human and absolutely brilliant.,0
"“It feels like there’s no moment of justice.” I think it’s because we’re waiting to be given justice from a subset in power who have violated their social contract with humanity and taken justice hostage.

Understand that it is not theirs to give. Justice will be rendered, whether the subset in power likes it or not.",0
I am coming to a point where I'm done talking. We have been talking for decades. I want immediate action. I'm done explaining myself to people with degrees.,0
"The ONLY reason we are talking about this is because someone was able to film it. His death would simply have been deemed a ""medical"" complication and life would have gone on just fine for the perpetrators.",0
"Trevor, I truly appreciated your perspective. It caused me to think differently about what is going on now.",0
Brilliant. I have watched this so many times.,0
"The way that man was leaning across Mr. George's neck is EXACTLY how I was trained in the Marines to take an enemy out in hand to hand combat. 
He was not kneeling on the man's shoulder....he wasn't on his back... he was directly across his neck, arteries and airway with his shin and all his weight. 
THAT'S a killing move pure and simple. 
No excuse, no mistake. 
I pray he goes from being an officer to being on death row for a hate crime with depraved indifference so there's no appeal",0
So she basically tried to kill man and the worst thing that happened to her was she lost her job. And her dog which she got back. and some may say she didn't try to kill him but she did. If someone cry's for help saying she is getting assaulted wouldn't you respond to the situation fully alert I wouldn't blame the cops for killing someone in this situation someone is being assaulted no way to know what is happening you respond hard. She did try to kill this man. In my opinion she should be locked away for a long time.,0
"small businesses have been looted- hardworking innocent people had their dreams destroyed.

"I love you Trevor Noah as you are My God's Honest Truth!! May He bless and protect you forever! !!! If only I could have a personal conversation with you, ahh, I'd give my left leg.

"America has been hit with a perfect storm. A devastating ongoing pandemic, a subsequent economic and financial disaster, racial and class divisiveness, environmental disasters, and all compounded and made much much worse by a divisive, self-centered and lying president. A president, mind you, who undeniably, on a daily basis, demonstrates a complete lack of presidential leadership and competency.",0
I’m so glad people chose this video to lead their perspective,0
"If it got more to you watching a target burn, than a black person being killed, then property means more to you than human lives",0
"I love this video. Trevor is so eloquent and invested in everything he does. I 100% agree. I will admit, my mom, who lives outside of the states, was deeply scared for me due to the looting and riots, but I tried my best to help her understand the level of frustration that led to that. I'm predisposed for COVID19 due to health issues so I can't participate in protest but I've been trying to help from home, one of the things I'm doing is translate as many sources of information as possible to help educate my people in the events and how to help. I'd love to translate this video as well but it's not open for contribution, I may have to make a transcript instead.",0
"It's kinda sad that the most sophisticated, wise and true statement in a while is coming from a comedian. Not a news station, reporter etc. 
I wish, Trevor had a liking to politics, he'd be a trustworthy representant. His ability to express and explain very complex matters in a couple of smooth sentences, understandable for everyone, projecting *exactly* the picture he's painted in his head, is remarkable. One of this generations outstanding minds!
Edit: thank you all for the likes, wow! And yeah, he is outstandingly smart *and* handsome, can't deny that, lol.",0
"Hello, I'm from Germany. The whole situation is really hard for me to imagine. We also have police brutality and racism here, but not to this extent (I don't want to offend anybody with that). That's why I think it's so good that people like Trevor recapitulate and analyze the whole situation in America, and that in a tone that doesn't offend anyone personally. I also think it's great that you appeal to American common sense and remind us that everyone is equal. Keep up the good work and greetings from Germany!",0
"Wow! Trevor Noah’s commentary is still heavy, even 2 weeks after George Floyd’s murder. Every single American, and especially students, should see this video. It could definitely be used as part of a social studies lesson.",0
"""What part of the contract is that?"" It's called the FINE PRINT. Anyone expecting YOU to sign THEIR contract, have included the FINE PRINT that gives THEM the leverage. Teach your CHILDREN about the FINE PRINT.",0
"The Gladwell quote in full (he remembered it pretty good) at 12:50
“...legitimacy is based on three things. First of all, the people who are asked to obey authority have to feel like they have a voice--that if they speak up, they will be heard. Second, the law has to be predictable. There has to be a reasonable expectation that the rules tomorrow are going to be roughly the same as the rules today. And third, the authority has to be fair. It can't treat one group differently from another.”",0
"Trevor Noah really has grown into his role on the Daily Show. The Daily Show has always straddled the lines between entertainment and news and editorial opinion, delivering insight not propaganda. This editorial is profound, and should be watched by everyone.",0
"Think of it as the ""Boston Tea Party"".",0
"Dear Trevor Noah, you brighten my mind, my heart. I am a Canadian from Montreal, who once fell in love with a young black Canadian (orig from Dominican Republic). He deepened my empathy for people of color, and still does . We need this now, more than we have in my lifetime...Profoundly. I am heavy-hearted yet hopeful , since George Floyd’s effect on the world...Especially as a white person, now relocated to Houston TX . You help me. Your eloquence, intelligence & thoughtful expression give my soul hope in this this time of protest... Faith
that we all begin to help heal the darkest wounds blacks in America have carried for too long. 
Sincerest thanks.💜

"Trevor Noah, you are an amazing man! I am grateful for you!",0
I see why Jon chose you. Your commentary and interview skills are impeccable. “Society is a contract”. Perfect doesn’t quite describe it,0
This was such an incredibly video. Thank you.,0
"Mr. Noah, I don’t know if you read these comments but I would like you to know how much I appreciate you. I struggle as a white woman trying to explain these concepts to people in my life because of my perspective. I empathize but I cannot completely understand because I have not lived those experiences. The way that you turn a phrase, create message, construct language is masterful. You help me better understand, and in turn, I hope I can plant seeds to help others understand as well. Thank you sir.",0
I am so pleased that I watched this video. Trevor Noah lived within apartheid in south Africa. He has perspective on this first hand. So eloquent... such a thought provoking video,0
Quarantine got EVERYBODY IN NEED OF THEIR BARBER! Love love Trevor Noah.,0
What broke me was when he called out for his mother. She's been dead for over a year. He felt her with him in his last moments.,0
"You always share wisdom resulting in chills, Trevor. 
You’re invaluable to this nation at this time. Thank you.😢❤️👍🏽❤️😢
Bless your mama and grandmama.",0
I think Trevor has surpassed his comedic abilities and should step into a civil rights leadership role. So few are able to speak thought-provoking truth like he has done in this video. America needs to hear more of this.,0

trevor noah.....next to get the knee,0
Great job Trevor in contextualizing a rather complex racially charged issue. You were spot on🎯,0
In my experience rich white men dont gain anything from change and it actually terrifies them. The possibility of their lives being affected by change i guess. They are aware of the situation and dont care in fact find it fascinating. Ive had rich famous white men call me a N word to my face like its a compliment. Honestly the women are worse. Ive been treated like a curiosity at work and my racist boss makes me straighten my hair. “You are so pretty for a black girl” seems to be a favorite among them. And they expect you to say omg thank you! instead of “bitch im gorgeous get out of my face”,0

"""Do as I say and not as I do"" does not work even on children, so why people assume that it would work with policing?",0
"You say there’s no “right way to protest”.. why can’t “the right way” be “peacefully”? Without causing harm to so many people and even leading to some of their deaths (including many of the ones you’re claiming to protect).. you can’t defend justice while committing even more unjust acts against the innocent. Anyway, I’m here because I’m trying to listen to both “sides” of the argument with an open mind and I don’t mean to create any more confrontation.. I get what you’re saying and I may agree with it to some extent, but I think you could perfectly make the same point without justifying violence and looting, because that’s exactly what prevents many people from hearing and understanding your arguments.",0
"When those who make the laws, break the laws, there is no law.",0
"If we think of the Social Contract, a la Jean Rousseau and Trevor Noah, it is NOT just broken with Black people. Black people are suffering from the one-sidedness of the contract’s protections and enforcement, but the contract has been broken for MANY of us. This group includes non-Blacks. It even includes non-Americans, as seen by global protests. The number of Whites, Asians, and Hispanics at the rallies is amazing. We aren’t there out of sympathy. We are there because we know this isn’t the America we agreed to call home. I loved Trevor’s whole talk. I just hope he knows that the Social Contract was broken for every ethical, peace-loving, non-racist American.",0
"Juneteenth— @TrevorNoah, I watched you on Anderson Cooper today explain how Amy knew she could weaponize the police and you forgot that she also did a great acting job on the 911 call, she cried and acted like an “African American” literally had her in imminent terror!!!

"I wish I was as eloquent - thanks for this perspective 


Lifting the veil stuck with me Bc that was definitely the catalyst- when it’s no longer a “hood” or “ghetto” problem. It’s a contract disruption and we are all part of this no matter how personally connected to the have-nots you THINK you are or are not... this hits home ❤️",0
Without the video evidence the police would have LIED ON FLOYD.,0
Absolutely correct! I am so happy you explain it the way you did. Now maybe ppl will get it. Thank you!🙏🏾,0
"People think there has to be a big action scene like in a movie for violence to take place. George Floyd's death was raw and in your face without a chase, without a gun fight, without a struggle, without resisting. This is the type of violence people of color face everyday in America. It doesn't always end in death, but that quiet violence is always there.",0
"Well said, I love listening to you talk, I’ve read ur books they’re amazing.",0
I'm glad Trevor invited us into his existential stream of consciousness. It was peaceful and enlightening.,0
Still listening to this,0
Goes back to when cops were slave patrol and night watchers. the slaves were set free and These patrol were authorised to protect white people and their property...they wanted to control the blacks as they were afraid that the blacks would rise up and seek revenge. White women had them coming to their rescue in no time. She would say all sorts of things which would determine the severity of punishment. We have to remember that segregation only ended 55 years ago so whites in their 40/50s were raise by parents during the time segregation laws were in full effect.,0
Can Trevor please interview Candace Owen? I think he's the only person that can be composed around her.,1
